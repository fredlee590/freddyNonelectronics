1 Overview
Partial Kerfuffle is intended to be a game that combines the strategic plotting that comes with being a strategic / political leader and the tactical tension that comes with being a battlefield commander. Players take on the role of the leaders of a map appropriate faction (kingdoms are to kings as cities are to gangs) and take turns making moves on any map, be it a city divided into districts or a country divided into provinces. If players clash, they take the battle to the dice game. Who will accomplish their objectives? All will try. The rest is chaos, also known as history.

4 Set up
	4.1 Overview
		Before a game of Partial Kerfuffle begins, three things must be set up for each player. They are
		1)	Each player must customize their faction banner
		2)	Each player must choose a starting location and be allocated starting armies
		3)	Each player must draw an objective card
	4.2 Faction customization
		Each player draws a small insignia to distinguish their faction's armies as they move around the map
        	Note: Creativity is encouraged, but insignias may be as simple as a single color or shape.
		Note: This must be done for each army under the players control.
			Hint: good for passing time during other people's turns.
	4.3 Strategic Map
		4.3.1 Starting locations
			Each player selects a province to use as his or her faction's base of operations.

			Each player is allocated two pawns and a knight for each province under their control at the start of the game.
		4.3.3 Castles
			Each player selects one (1) province anywhere on the map to place a castle.
	4.4 Objective cards
		4.4.1 Description
			Each player draws a card from the Objective Deck. This card defines the player's win condition. Upon drawing the card, the player may tell the other players their objective or keep it hidden. They are not bound to the truth :)
			Note: Each player is allowed one redraw in the event of dissatisfaction.

8 Variations
	By default, this game was envisioned with a simple, one player one kingdom sort of format. However, others may also be interesting. For example,
	1) Teams
		Two or more players may be assigned to a kingdom. They must decide amongst themselves which strategies to execute and how to execute them. They must also collaborate to make the tough decisions as they arise...
	2) Various maps
		This is not limited to the default map. Any may be used: real, fictional, foreign, or domestic.
