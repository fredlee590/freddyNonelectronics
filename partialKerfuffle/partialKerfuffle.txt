1 Overview
Partial Kerfuffle is intended to be a game that combines the strategic plotting that comes with being a strategic / political leader and the tactical tension that comes with being a battlefield commander. Players take on the role of the leaders of a map appropriate faction (kingdoms are to kings as cities are to gangs) and take turns making moves on any map, be it a city divided into districts or a country divided into provinces. If players clash, they take the battle to the chess board. Who will accomplish their objectives? All will try. The rest is chaos, also known as history.
