Hey all!

I'm contacting you all for three reasons.

First, based on how I know you, there's a possibility that you'd be open to a less than usual suggestion. Also, based on how you know me, this will probably not be too surprising. There's no way to make this sound less nerdy or more useful, so here it is.

I made a board game.

I know what you're thinking.

Yes, like Monopoly, you plagued skeptic. Fall in line! But really, it's a strategy thing, so it's a bit more like Risk, but more modular and faster paced (in theory). I envision a big part of the fun coming from forming alliances, breaking them, master plans for specific ends; that sort of thing. There. Not so ridiculous, right? Also, depending on how many of you make a particular decision, the personalities around the table should make it fun all around!

If you need more insight, know that I've been watching a lot of this:

As for how effective it'll be at the fun-making, it's currently in testing. But I'm pretty sure neurons will fire in some capacity. I've attached a rule set, but there are still some materials to be made (or gathered from household items). Also, I'm lacking a venue.

Second, I've heard that Dalrek and Kevin have always made efforts to pull something together and this is probably off-the-wall enough to be something different.

Third, I know y'all, so it's not THAT weird. Still don't know about "y'all," though. :)

PS. If it seems like I have too much time on my hands, the opposite is actually true. This was done incrementally with stolen time over the course of several months that I'll never get back. May as well capitalize.

Cheers!

Freddy
